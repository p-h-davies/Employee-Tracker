## Description:
This application was designed so users can have an easy, at-hand system to view their employee records. It provides terminal access to a database, which stores information about a company's departments, roles, employees and salaries.


## Installation:
To use this application, you will need to install Node.js and ensure you have a Terminator emulator Software installed (such as Terminal for Mac, or Bash for Windows). 

Before running the code, it is important to run 'npm i' in your terminal, to ensure all packages are transferred to your machine.

## Usage:
Open the folder 'Employee-Tracker' in your terminal, then type 'npm i' to ensure all packages are working on your machine.

Next, type 'index node.js' to trigger the questions list. Answer all questions according to instruction.  

Once all questions have been answered, you will see a 'Success!' message appear, and a logo.svg file will appear in the folder.

Next, you can view your logo by either opening it in your browser or through an SVG previewer. Once you're happy with the design, move the logo.svg folder into your own chosen folder and close the program.
