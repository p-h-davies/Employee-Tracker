## Installation:
To use this application, you will need to install Node.js and ensure you have a Terminator emulator Software installed (such as Terminal for Mac, or Bash for Windows). 

Before running the code, it is important to run 'npm i' in your terminal, to ensure all packages are transferred to your machine.

If you select any of the 'View' options, you will see the requested information appear in tables in your terminal:
